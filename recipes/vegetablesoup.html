    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><strong>I love this easy vegetable soup</strong> recipe and make it often!
        It’s made with a light tomato broth and packed with healthy 
        veggies. It’s so comforting and satisfying!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped carrot</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped celery</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground fennel seed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional for heat)</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can of diced tomatoes with liquid</li>
        <li>6 cups (1420ml) stock or broth</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped potato</li>
        <li>3 to 4 heaped cups chopped or shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>(optional) 1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium 
            heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and tomato paste. 
            Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables have softened 
            and the onions are translucent, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, fennel, black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of salt,
            and the red pepper flakes. Cook, while stirring, for one minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the canned tomatoes and their juices and the stock/broth.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes, cabbage, and bay leaves. Raise the heat to
            medium-high and bring the soup to a boil. Partially cover the pot 
            with a lid, then reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes and other vegetables
            are tender. Add the frozen peas and cook for five more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and remove the bay leaves. 
            Stir in the cider vinegar (or use lemon juice). Taste and season 
            with more salt, pepper, or vinegar. Serve.</li>    
    </ol>
