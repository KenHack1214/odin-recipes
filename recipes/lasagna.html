    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>There are just three components that make a lasagna great:
    the pasta, the cheese, and the sauce. Since this recipe starts 
    with a jar of marinara for ease, make sure it’s one that tastes great.
    My favorite brand is Rao’s, but choose your personal favorite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 25 ounce jar of marinara sauce </li>
        <li>12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded about 3 cups</li>
        <li>15 dry lasagna noodles, don't get no-boil </li>
        <li>15 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400ºF. Arrange a rack in the middle of
            the oven and heat the oven to 400°F.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil
            in a 12-inch or larger regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high
            heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 1 pound lean ground beef,
            1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black
            pepper, and cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a 
            wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. 
            Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce. Open 1 
            (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer 
            of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the 
            remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Begin layering the lasagna. Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella
            cheese if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking 
            dish, breaking them if needed to create a single layer (it’s OK if 
            the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the 
            ricotta cheese over the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups 
            of the meat sauce on the ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of the 
            mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Continue layering the lasagna. Arrange 5 more noodles over the 
            mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of 
            the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer
            of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so 
            that it almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 
            1 cup mozzarella for the end of baking.) Cover the dish tightly with 
            aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour. Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the
            noodles are done by poking the lasagna with a knife; the knife should 
            slide easily through all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook 
            for 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking. Uncover 
            the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake 
            uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and 
            the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes. Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack
            for at least 15 minutes before serving.</li>
